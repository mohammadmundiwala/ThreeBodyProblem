Course Project for ME5895 - Nonlinear Systems

As of 12/14/2024, the entirety of the code used in this project is not uploaded. It will be uploaded ASAP once it is cleaned up and readable.  main.ipynb was the first iteration that I started with and from there continued work in dfferent files. these dozen or so files will be simplified and condensed over winter break.
